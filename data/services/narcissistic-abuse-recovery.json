  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How long does narcissistic abuse recovery take?",
      "answer": "Recovery time varies depending on the severity and duration of abuse, individual circumstances, and personal factors. Some people see significant progress in 6-12 months, while others may need 1-2 years or longer for complete healing. We work at your pace and provide ongoing support throughout your journey."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I ever trust people again after narcissistic abuse?",
      "answer": "Yes, it's possible to rebuild trust, but it takes time and work. We help you develop healthy boundaries, recognize red flags, and build trust gradually with safe people. You'll learn to trust your own judgment and intuition again."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm still in contact with the narcissistic person?",
      "answer": "We can work with you regardless of your current situation. If you're still in contact, we'll focus on safety planning, boundary setting, and developing strategies to protect yourself. If you've gone no-contact, we'll support your healing and help you maintain healthy boundaries."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it normal to feel guilty or doubt myself during recovery?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. These feelings are common and often result from the gaslighting and manipulation you experienced. Part of recovery involves recognizing these feelings as symptoms of abuse, not reality. We help you develop self-compassion and trust in your own perceptions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can narcissistic abuse recovery help with other mental health issues?",
      "answer": "Yes. Narcissistic abuse often co-occurs with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other mental health conditions. Our trauma-informed approach addresses the root causes and helps improve overall mental health and well-being."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm worried about the cost of therapy?",
      "answer": "We offer flexible payment options and can work with your budget. Many insurance plans cover therapy for trauma and mental health conditions. We also offer sliding scale fees for those who qualify. Your healing is important, and we're committed to making therapy accessible."
