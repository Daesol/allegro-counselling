  "fullDescription": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects how individuals communicate, interact, and process information. At Allegro Counselling, we recognize that autism is not a disorder to be cured, but a different way of being that comes with unique strengths and challenges.\n\nOur comprehensive autism services include thorough assessment and diagnosis for children, adolescents, and adults, followed by personalized support that honors neurodivergent ways of thinking and being. We understand that each individual on the spectrum is unique, with their own strengths, challenges, and support needs.\n\nWhether you're seeking diagnosis for yourself or your child, looking for support with social communication, sensory processing, or executive functioning, or wanting to better understand and embrace your autistic identity, our experienced team is here to help. We believe in a strengths-based approach that celebrates neurodivergence while providing practical support for daily challenges.\n\nOur approach combines evidence-based therapeutic techniques with a deep understanding of autism, helping you develop strategies that work with your unique brain rather than trying to make you fit into neurotypical expectations. From improving social skills and communication to managing sensory sensitivities and building self-advocacy, we're committed to supporting your journey toward greater confidence and fulfillment.",
