  "fullDescription": "Inner child work is a powerful therapeutic approach that helps you connect with and heal the wounded parts of yourself that developed during childhood. At Allegro Counselling, we understand that many of our adult struggles, patterns, and emotional responses are rooted in early experiences that shaped how we see ourselves and the world.\n\nOur inner child work services help you identify and heal childhood wounds, develop self-compassion, and create a more loving relationship with yourself. Whether you experienced trauma, neglect, criticism, or simply didn't receive the emotional support you needed, inner child work can help you heal these wounds and develop greater self-acceptance.\n\nThrough gentle, compassionate therapeutic techniques, we help you reconnect with your inner child, understand their needs and emotions, and provide the love, validation, and support they may have missed. This process often leads to profound healing, increased self-esteem, and the ability to break free from limiting patterns that developed in childhood.\n\nOur approach is gentle, respectful, and always honors your pace and comfort level. We believe that healing your inner child is one of the most powerful ways to create lasting change and build a more fulfilling, authentic life.",
