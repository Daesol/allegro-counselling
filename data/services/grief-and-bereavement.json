    {
      "question": "How long does grief counselling take?",
      "answer": "Grief has no timeline, and everyone's journey is unique. Some people find significant relief in 3-6 months, while others may need 1-2 years or longer. We work at your pace and understand that grief is not something you 'get over' but something you learn to live with."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it normal to feel guilty after someone dies?",
      "answer": "Yes, guilt is a very common emotion in grief. You might feel guilty about things you did or didn't do, about feeling relief if the person was suffering, or about moving forward with your life. These feelings are normal and we can help you process them."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not crying or showing emotions?",
      "answer": "Everyone grieves differently. Some people cry openly, others process grief more internally. There's no 'right' way to grieve. We support whatever emotional expression feels natural and authentic to you."
    },
    {
      "question": "When will I start feeling better?",
      "answer": "Grief is not linear - you may have good days and difficult days, sometimes unexpectedly. Healing happens gradually, and it's normal to have setbacks. We help you understand that this is part of the natural grieving process."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm grieving but others expect me to 'move on'?",
      "answer": "Society often has unrealistic expectations about grief timelines. We help you honor your own grieving process and communicate your needs to others. Your grief is valid regardless of how much time has passed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can grief counselling help with physical symptoms?",
      "answer": "Yes. Grief can manifest physically through fatigue, changes in appetite, sleep problems, and other symptoms. We address both the emotional and physical aspects of grief to support your overall well-being."
