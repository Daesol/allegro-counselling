  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How does EMDR work?",
      "answer": "EMDR works by helping your brain process traumatic memories that have become stuck. The bilateral stimulation (eye movements, taps, or sounds) helps your brain naturally process and integrate these experiences, reducing their emotional intensity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does EMDR treatment take?",
      "answer": "The duration varies depending on the complexity and number of traumatic experiences. Some people see significant improvement in 6-12 sessions, while others may need longer-term treatment for complex trauma."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is EMDR safe?",
      "answer": "Yes, EMDR is a safe, evidence-based therapy. Our certified EMDR therapists ensure you feel safe and in control throughout the process, and we always work at your pace."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't want to talk about my trauma?",
      "answer": "EMDR doesn't require you to talk extensively about your trauma. You can share as much or as little as you're comfortable with, and the therapy can still be effective."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can EMDR help with anxiety and depression?",
      "answer": "Yes! EMDR is highly effective for anxiety, depression, and other conditions that may be rooted in traumatic experiences or distressing memories."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens during an EMDR session?",
      "answer": "During EMDR, you'll focus on a traumatic memory while following the therapist's finger movements or other bilateral stimulation. This helps your brain process the memory naturally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to have a specific diagnosis to benefit from EMDR?",
      "answer": "No, EMDR can help with a wide range of issues including trauma, anxiety, depression, phobias, grief, and other distressing experiences, regardless of diagnosis."
