  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How long does trauma counselling take?",
      "answer": "The duration varies depending on the type and severity of trauma, individual circumstances, and personal factors. Some people see significant progress in 3-6 months, while others may need 1-2 years or longer. We work at your pace and prioritize your safety and comfort throughout the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will talking about trauma make it worse?",
      "answer": "We use a phased approach that prioritizes your safety and stability. We won't process trauma until you're ready and have the necessary coping skills. Our trauma-informed approach ensures that therapy is always conducted at your pace and comfort level."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't remember all the details of my trauma?",
      "answer": "That's completely normal and common. You don't need to remember every detail to heal from trauma. We focus on how trauma affects you now and work with what you do remember. The goal is to reduce current symptoms and improve your quality of life."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can trauma counselling help with other mental health issues?",
      "answer": "Yes. Trauma often underlies or contributes to other mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, substance use, and relationship problems. Addressing trauma can significantly improve these other conditions and overall mental health."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not sure if what I experienced was trauma?",
      "answer": "If something is affecting your life negatively, it's worth exploring in therapy. Trauma can result from many different experiences, and what's traumatic for one person may not be for another. We can help you understand how your experiences have impacted you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it normal to feel worse before feeling better?",
      "answer": "Sometimes, yes. As you begin to process trauma, you might temporarily experience increased symptoms. This is often a sign that healing is beginning. We'll work together to manage these symptoms and ensure you have the support you need during this process."
