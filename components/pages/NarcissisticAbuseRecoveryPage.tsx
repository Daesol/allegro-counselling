  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How do I know if I've experienced narcissistic abuse?",
      answer:
        "Narcissistic abuse often involves patterns of manipulation, gaslighting, emotional invalidation, control, and exploitation. Common signs include feeling confused about reality, walking on eggshells, loss of self-confidence, isolation from support systems, and feeling responsible for the abuser's emotions. A qualified therapist can help you identify these patterns.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it normal to still have feelings for my narcissistic abuser?",
      answer:
        "Yes, this is completely normal and part of the trauma bonding that occurs in abusive relationships. Narcissistic abuse creates powerful psychological bonds through intermittent reinforcement. These feelings don't invalidate your experience or mean you should return to the relationship. Therapy can help you understand and work through these complex emotions.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does recovery from narcissistic abuse take?",
      answer:
        "Recovery is a highly individual process that depends on factors like the duration and severity of abuse, your support system, and personal resilience. While some people notice improvements within months, deeper healing often takes 1-3 years or more. Remember that healing isn't linear, and setbacks are normal parts of the process.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I ever be able to trust again after narcissistic abuse?",
      answer:
        "Yes, with proper support and healing, you can learn to trust again. Recovery involves rebuilding trust in yourself first, then gradually learning to trust others. This process takes time and patience, but many survivors go on to have healthy, fulfilling relationships. Therapy can help you develop discernment and healthy relationship skills.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should I go no contact with my narcissistic abuser?",
      answer:
        "No contact is often recommended when possible, as it allows for healing without continued manipulation and abuse. However, this isn't always feasible, especially with co-parenting situations or family relationships. We can help you develop strategies for your specific situation, whether that's no contact, low contact, or structured contact with strong boundaries.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can narcissistic abusers change?",
      answer:
        "While personality change is theoretically possible, it's extremely rare for individuals with narcissistic traits to genuinely change, as it requires acknowledging their behavior and committing to intensive, long-term therapy. Most importantly, it's not your responsibility to wait for or facilitate their change. Focus on your own healing and protection.",
