          "The duration of depression treatment varies depending on the severity of symptoms, individual circumstances, and treatment goals. Many clients see improvements within 12-16 sessions, though some may benefit from longer-term support. We'll work with you to create a personalized treatment plan that fits your specific needs.",

        question: "What's the difference between sadness and clinical depression?",
        answer:
          "While sadness is a normal emotional response to life events, clinical depression involves persistent symptoms that significantly impact daily functioning for at least two weeks. Depression affects sleep, appetite, energy, concentration, and overall quality of life in ways that normal sadness does not.",

      {
        question: "Can depression be treated without medication?",
        answer:
          "Yes, many people successfully manage depression through therapy alone. Research shows that psychotherapy can be as effective as medication for many types of depression. However, some individuals may benefit from a combination of therapy and medication, which we can discuss and coordinate with your healthcare provider.",

        question: "Is it normal to feel worse before feeling better in therapy?",
        answer:
          "It's not uncommon to experience some emotional intensity early in therapy as you begin to process difficult feelings and experiences. This is often a sign that the therapeutic work is beginning. We'll support you through this process and help you develop coping strategies to manage any temporary increases in distress.",

      {
        question: "How do I know if I need professional help for depression?",
        answer:
          "Consider seeking professional help if you're experiencing persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in sleep or appetite, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, or thoughts of self-harm for more than two weeks. If depression is interfering with your work, relationships, or daily functioning, professional support can be very beneficial.",
